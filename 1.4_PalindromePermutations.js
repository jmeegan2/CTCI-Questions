/*

Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a 
palinÂ­ drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A 
permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just 
dictionary words.

EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)

I: String
O: Boolean Value
C: Optimize
E: Empty String, spaces between characters and in front at end more tahn 2 of the same char, even and odd chars

time complexity: linear O(N)
space complexity: linear O(N)

    //if even: there must be two of every char
    //if odd: there must be only one unique char

    //use hash table to store letters
    //if we see the same letter again, delete from hash
    //check hash at the end: odd - 1 key left, even - no keys left
    //skip spaces
